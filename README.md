# Mediator

This repository is for my studies of the Mediator pattern. Each branch contains a different implementation.

- [no-deps](https://github.com/rodrigofigueira/mediator/tree/no-deps): No dependencies, the simplest conceptual version
- [chat-no-deps](https://github.com/rodrigofigueira/mediator/tree/chat-no-deps): Chat without deps.
- [using-mediatR](https://github.com/rodrigofigueira/mediator/tree/using-mediatR): Using MediatR.
